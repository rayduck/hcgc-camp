# Contributing to IRS Green Council Camp Website

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct explains the *bare minimum* behavior
expectations IRS requires of its contributors.

## Issue Contributions

When opening new issues or commenting on existing issues on this repository
please make sure discussions are related to concrete technical issues with the software.


## Code Contributions

This document will guide you through the contribution process.

### Step 1: Fork

Fork the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/rayduck/hcgc-camp) and check out your
copy locally.

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/:username/hcgc-camp
$ cd hcgc-camp
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/rayduck/hcgc-camp
```

#### Which branch?

For developing new features and bug fixes, the `master` branch should be pulled
and built upon.


### Step 2: Branch

Create a branch and start hacking:

```text
$ git checkout -b my-branch -t origin/master
```

### Step 3: Commit

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```text
$ git config --global user.name "J. Random User"
$ git config --global user.email "j.random.user@example.com"
```

Add and commit:

```text
$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
```

Writing good commit logs is important. A commit log should describe what
changed and why. Follow these guidelines when writing one:

1. The first line should be 50 characters or less and contain a short
   description of the change. All words in the description should be in
   lowercase with the exception of proper nouns, acronyms, and the ones that
   refer to code, like function/variable names. The description should
   be prefixed with the name of the changed subsystem and start with an
   imperative verb. Example: "net: add localAddress and localPort
   to Socket"
2. Keep the second line blank.
3. Wrap all other lines at 72 columns.

A good commit log can look something like this:

```txt
subsystem: explain the commit in one line

Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
being fixed, etc.

The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
72 characters or so. That way, `git log` will show things
nicely even when it is indented.
```

The header line should be meaningful; it is what other people see when they
run `git shortlog` or `git log --oneline`.

Check the output of `git log --oneline files_that_you_changed` to find out
what subsystem (or subsystems) your changes touch.

If your patch fixes an open issue, you can add a reference to it at the end
of the log. Use the `Fixes:` prefix and the full issue URL. For example:

```txt
Fixes: https://github.com/rayduck/hcgc-camp/issues/1337
```


### Step 4: Rebase

Use `git rebase` (not `git merge`) to sync your work from time to time.

```text
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/master
```

### Step 5: Test

Make sure that the code actually works through intensive testing and ensuring that the stuff you built is actually decent.

### Step 6: Push

```text
$ git push origin my-branch
```

Go to https://github.com/:username/hcgc-camp and select your branch.
Click the 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form.

Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days.

### Step 7: Discuss and update

You will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your Pull Request.
This is a big part of the submission process so don't be disheartened!

To make changes to an existing Pull Request, make the changes to your branch.
When you push that branch to your fork, GitHub will automatically update the
Pull Request.

You can push more commits to your branch:

```text
$ git add my/changed/files
$ git commit
$ git push origin my-branch
```

Or you can rebase against master:

```text
$ git fetch --all
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
```

Or you can amend the last commit (for example if you want to change the commit
log).

```text
$ git add any/changed/files
$ git commit --amend
$ git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
```

**Important:** The `git push --force-with-lease` command is one of the few ways
to delete history in git. Before you use it, make sure you understand the risks.
If in doubt, don't use it.

Feel free to post a comment in the Pull Request to ping reviewers if you are
awaiting an answer on something.

Note that multiple commits often get squashed when they are landed

### Step 8: Landing

When a collaborator lands your Pull Request, they will post
a comment to the Pull Request page mentioning the commit(s) it
landed as. GitHub often shows the Pull Request as `Closed` at this
point, but don't worry. If you look at the branch you raised your
Pull Request against (probably `master`), you should see a commit with
your name on it. Congratulations and thanks for your contribution!
